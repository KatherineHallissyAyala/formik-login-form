# formik-login-form
This project is a basic email/password form that uses React and Formik to validate and store user data.
# How to Run
In the terminal, browse to the root folder of this project. Run npm install and npm start.
# Usage
When the browser loads, the user should see a password with two fields (email and password) and a Submit button.  If the user tries to submit while the email or password are left blank, a red "Required field" error message displays.  If the user clicks login with all fields complete, an alert box displays, which says, "login succssful."
# Support

# Roadmap for future improvements
